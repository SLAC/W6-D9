  <p>It was the first time this approach, known as “scientific machine learning,” has been applied to battery cycling, said Will Chueh, an associate professor at Stanford University and investigator with the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory who led the study. </p>
  <p>The research, reported today in Nature Materials, is the latest result from a collaboration between Stanford, SLAC, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Toyota Research Institute (TRI). The goal is to bring together foundational research and industry know-how to develop a long-lived electric vehicle battery that can be charged in 10 minutes.</p>`,

We look forward to building on this work through future experiments to achieve lower-cost, better-performing batteries.”</p>
  <h2>A trio of advances</h2>
  <p>The new study builds on two previous advances where the group used more conventional forms of machine learning to dramatically accelerate both battery testing and the process of winnowing down many possible charging methods to find the ones that work best.</p>`,

  <h3>Combining all three approaches</h3>
  <p>Combining all three approaches could potentially slash the time needed to bring a new battery technology from the lab bench to the consumer by as much as two-thirds, Chueh said.</p>
  <p>“In this case, we are teaching the machine how to learn the physics of a new type of failure mechanism that could help us design better and safer fast-charging batteries,” Chueh said. “Fast charging is incredibly stressful and damaging to batteries, and solving this problem is key to expanding the nation’s fleet of electric vehicles as part of the overall strategy for fighting climate change.”</p>
  <p>The new combined approach can also be applied to developing the grid-scale battery systems needed for a greater deployment of wind and solar electricity, which will become even more urgent as the nation pursues recently announced Biden Administration goals of eliminating fossil fuels from electric power generation by 2035 and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>`,
