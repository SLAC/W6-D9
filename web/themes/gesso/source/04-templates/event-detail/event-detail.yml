  <p>The Higgs boson was discovered in 2012 at the world’s most powerful particle collider,
  the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. This particle plays a unique role
  in fundamental physics. It gives all of the known elementary particles, including itself,
  their masses. To do this, it must transmit a new force to other particles, and it must also
  interact with itself. This last aspect is particularly strange, and has not been explored
  in experiments yet. Higgs bosons are extremely rare even at the LHC – only one of them is
  produced per billion particle collisions – and their extremely short lifetime means they
  are not directly visible. They can only be studied indirectly by analyzing the particle
  collisions in which they participate.</p>
  <p>At SLAC we are constructing the core of the biggest and fastest camera ever built to
  capture the Higgs boson in action. With more than 100 times more pixels than a typical
  digital camera, each one of which is much faster and more sensitive than typical camera pixels,
  it will be 10 times more powerful than the current cameras used to capture the results of
  particle collisions at the LHC.</p>
